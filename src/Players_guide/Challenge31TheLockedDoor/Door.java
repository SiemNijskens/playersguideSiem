/*
An open door can always be closed.
        A closed (but not locked) door can always be opened.
A closed door can always be locked.
A locked door can be unlocked, but a numeric passcode is needed, and the door will only unlock if
the code supplied matches the doorâ€™s current passcode.
When a door is created, it must be given an initial passcode.
        Additionally, you should be able to change the passcode by supplying the current code and a new
one. The passcode should only change if the correct, current code is given.
        Objectives:

v Define a Door class that can keep track of whether it is locked, open, or closed.
v Make it so you can perform the four transitions defined above with methods.
v Build a constructor that requires the starting numeric passcode.
v Build a method that will allow you to change the passcode for an existing door by supplying the
current passcode and new passcode. Only change the passcode if the current passcode is correct.
Make your main method ask the user for a starting passcode, then create a new Door instance. Allow
the user to attempt the four transitions described above (open, close, lock, unlock) and change the
code by typing in text commands*/
